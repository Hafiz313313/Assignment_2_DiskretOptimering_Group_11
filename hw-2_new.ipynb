If an edge $(u,v)$ is already covered by a vertex in $S$, do nothing. Otherwise add to $S$ the vertex $u$ if $x^*(u) \\geq x^*(v)$, or $v$ otherwise (where ${\\bf x}^*$ is the LP optimum solution computed in part (b).  Comment why this also results in a vertex cover and has cost no more than that corresponding to the rounding rule in part (b). Compare the cost of the solution produced by this rule to the optimal solution."
